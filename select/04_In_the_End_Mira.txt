Bring me down bring me down
Bitter life you have no fear
Bring me down bring me down
Muddle through my hollow tears
Hardly there still i swear
I will prove my love is real
Softer then in the end
Fall into my soul my dear

Wasted all you see is all i am
Faces all you see is all i am
Holding on all i care
Holding on all i share

Bring me down bring me down
Bitter life you have no fear
Bring me down bring me down
Muddle through my hollow tears

Wasted all you see is all i am
Faces all you see is all i am
Holding on all i care
Holding on all i share
