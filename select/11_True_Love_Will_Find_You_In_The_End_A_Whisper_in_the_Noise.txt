(Originally by Daniel Johnston)

True love will find you in the end
You'll find out just who's your friend
Don't be sad at all who will
But don't give up until
True love will find you in the end

This sits a promise with a catch
Only if you're looking can it find you
True love it's searching too
How can it recognize you
Unless you step out into the light, the light?
Don't be sad at all I know you will
But don't give up until
True love will find you in the end
